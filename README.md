* **additions**
  * **arduino test sketches:** contains various little code snippets used to test hardware functionality and software concepts.
  * **gyro calibration utility:** java source for a serial data plotter used for calibrating the IMU. More info in the tech doc.
* **cad:** Contains the most recent set of SolidWorks 2017 project files. "Bottom Plate Rework Assembly.SLDASM" being the main file to be opened here.
  * **old versions:** Previous prototypes of the design, including a now unused omniwheel design and the first and second prototype iterations.
  * **thin plates:** Modified files that ended up being used, as the thick plates of the original design couldn't be printed. As seen in the media files, we ended up using thin printed parts and filling the space up with 3mm wooden plates.
* **doc:** The technical documentation containing lots of further insights into the project (German).
* **media:** Videos and photos of the final robot build.
* **src:** Final arduino code.
